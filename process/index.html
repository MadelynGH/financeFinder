                Once I decided to participate in the challenge, I thought about the project. 
                My idea was to have a money sorter, where you can organize your needs, wants, savings, profit, income, etc. 
                Then I created a model drawing.

                I built the desktop app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                These are three text-based programming languages that are primarily designed for the web. 
                HTML is for the elements, like “button”. CSS is for styling, like changing the color. 
                JavaScript is probably the main part of my website - I used JavaScript to make it interactive. 
                I also made myself a to-do list so I could manage my time.

                I designed the mobile app in Figma, which is a prototyping tool.
