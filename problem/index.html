            <p class="yes-links">
                I researched about AI in finance. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/discover/finance-ai#:~:text=AI%20in%20finance%20can%20help,automate%20operations%20and%20reduce%20costs." target="_blank">Google Cloud blog</a>,
                AI in finance can help in five general areas:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>personalize services and products</li>
                    <li>create opportunities</li>
                    <li>manage risk and fraud</li>
                    <li>enable transparency and compliance</li>
                    <li>automate operations and reduce costs</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="yes-links">
                The <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/what-is/ai-in-finance.html#:~:text=For%20financial%20institutions,evaluate%20potential%20risk." target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a> says: For financial institutions, AI lets organizations accelerate and automate historically manual and time-consuming tasks like market research. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of data to identify trends and help forecast future performance, letting investors chart investment growth and evaluate potential risk.<br><br>AI is cool. But it has some limitations - it is just a
                computer program. It doesn't think the way we humans do. So let's
                go to <a href="https://www.jatinderpalaha.com/limitations-of-artificial-intelligence/#Lack-of-Emotional-and-Social-Understanding:~:text=AI%20decision%2Dmaking.-,Lack%20of%20Emotional%20and%20Social%20Understanding,of%20human%20behaviour%2C%20such%20as%20mental%20health%20diagnosis%20or%20customer%20service.,-Ethical%20and%20Privacy" target="_blank">Jatinder Palaha</a>. One of the limitations is Lack of Emotional
                and Social Understanding. AI falls short in understanding human
                emotions, cultural norms, and social cues.

                <a href="https://penchecks.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-financial-services-industry/#:~:text=Lack%20of%20Human,reduce%20customer%20satisfaction." target="_blank">Pen Checks</a> says that AI can also have an adverse effect on human interaction. Many customers prefer to speak to a human when they have a financial query or problem. However, the increasing use of AI means they can only interact with a machine, which can frustrate customers and reduce customer satisfaction.
                <br><br>
                Out of all these things, I decided to focus on creating a <u>personalized budgeting tool</u> that helps people manage their money better and stay out of debt.
                <br><br>
                Here's a summary of General Research:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI in finance can help in five general areas: personalize services and products, create opportunities, manage risk and fraud, enable transparency and compliance, and automate operations and reduce costs</li>

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="social-inequalities">Social Inequalities- Problem</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                There are a lot of social inequalities in finance. One of them is that some people are born into a poor family.
                Some people are born into a rich family. A whopping <u>21%</u> of rich people were born into a rich family!
                This is not fair for those who were born into a less wealthy family. They get fewer opportunities than those who were born rich!
                <u>49%</u> of babies born into a poor family will be poor for at least half their childhood.
                The richest <u>1%</u> in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom <u>90%</u>.
                <br><br>
                <u>97%</u> of people in debt say that they would be happier without it.
                <u>80%</u> of Americans are in debt and <u>73%</u> pass away with debt.
                The debt of an average American is about <u>$100,000</u>!
                In 2021, the population of the United States was about <u>331.9 million</u>.
                This means that the total debt of all the citizens of the US was 331,900,000 x $100,000 = <u>3.319e+13</u>, or <u>$33,190,000,000,000</u>!
                That's crazy!
                <br><br>
                So how do people get into debt in the first place? There are a few reasons, such as
                spending more than you bring in, spending freely or extravagantly, sudden emergencies, high interest rates, and inflation.
                Every month, the average American spends <u>$288</u> on entertainment, <u>$300</u> on eating out, and <u>$148</u> on fast food.
                Their income is about <u>$4,800</u> per month and their biggest expense is housing, which costs <u>$2,025</u> per month.
