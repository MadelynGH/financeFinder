                I designed this mobile app on Figma. The mobile app is for when the user wants to make a quick decision. 
                They would input the item they want and the cost, and the AI would analyze stuff like how much extra money they have. 
                <br>
                Then, the AI would tell the user if they should buy it or not. 
                There are similar apps, like Mint or Goodbudget, but they are for purchases you already made. My 
                solution is for the user to make a decision before they make the purchase.
                <br>
                The other solutions are also require a lot of thinking for the user before buying something. 
                My solution is a lot faster and easier.
