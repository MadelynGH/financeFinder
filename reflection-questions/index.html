                <span class="question">How does your project use AI to help people with their finances in a way that hasn't been done before?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    My project is a budgeting tool that will help the user manage their finances.
                    The desktop web app is for when the user wants to sit at their computer and do deep analysis.
                    The mobile app is for when the user wants to decide quickly whether to make a purchase or not.
                    <br>
                    Other similar tools, like Mint or Goodbudget are for purchases that have already been made;
                    the user can't change anything about that purchase if it's already made.
                    Finance Finder is different. In the mobile app, the user will input what they're about to buy and how much it costs,
                    and the AI will make a decision about whether the user should purchase that.
                    This is what makes Finance Finder unique.

                <span class="question">Describe a challenge you faced. How did you overcome it? How did you reach out for help?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    Trial and error are how people learn. 
                    If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything! 
                    One of the challenges I faced was getting it to do the <b>calculating</b> part. 
                    The calculating itself wasn't extremely hard, but getting the values from <b>localStorage</b> was a big challenge. 
                    There was so much drama because of <b>object types</b>.
                    I got it working by taking a new approach at the situation.

                <span class="question">What did you learn from this process that will impact the way you interact with technology in the future?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    I don't think I ever used the JavaScript localStorage object before this. 
                    When I was deciding what to use to <b>store the data</b> so it remembers, I couldn't think of a way to accomplish this so it <b>saves it forever</b>. 
                    Then I remembered a coding book that talked about localStorage. 
                    I Googled “how long does localStorage last”, and I learned that it lasts forever, unless you call the localStorage.clear() function. 
                    Now I have a new method in my toolbox!

                <span class="question">Why did you choose this format for your project?</span>
                <br>
                <span class="answer">
                    I <u>created</u> a <b>desktop</b> version, <u>designed</u> a <b>mobile</b> version, and I have an <u>idea</u> for a <b>browser extension</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    The desktop version is when the user first starts using Finance Finder, or if they make a big change.
                    It's for them to input the stuff that doesn't change very often.
                    For example, their needs don't really change.
                    They can't just decide, "I'm not going to buy food this month," or something like that.
                    Their job(s) don't change very often either, and neither do their assets.
                    So the desktop version is for when they want to sit down at their computer and make a big change.
                    <br><br>
                    The mobile version is when the user wants to buy something they don't need, like going out to eat.
                    The AI will calculate their budget, how much they spent in that group that month, etc.
                    It will give them either a checkmark, a question mark, or an X.
                    The user will get a checkmark if they can afford the item easily.
                    They'll get a question mark if it's their decision, eg. they can afford it, but there was something else they were saving up for.
                    They'll get an X if they can't afford it.
                    <br><br>
                    The desktop version is for online shopping.
                    When the user is about to purchase something that they can't afford, the AI will send an alert and tell them to think twice.
                    If the user can afford it, it would say something like, "Okay, you can afford that. Go ahead and purchase it!"
                    If the user is going to pay more than something's worth, it would browse the web to find cheaper options.
                    Also, based on their purchase history, it would make recommendations for alternative/additional items to purchase, or tell them that they should stop buying something.
                    <br><br>
                    So Finance Finder has three different formats for their own unique reasons.
