                <span class="question">How does your project use AI to help people with their finances in a way that hasn't been done before?</span>
                <br />
                <span class="answer">My project is a interactive tool. It is unique for its <b>design and customizability</b>. It allows the user to input their data. Then it <b>calculates it and gives tips</b> - that's the AI part!</span>
                <br />
                <span class="question">Describe a challenge you faced. How did you overcome it? How did you reach out for help?</span>
                <br />
                <span class="answer">Trial and error are how people learn. If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything! One of the challenges I faced was getting it to do the <b>calculating</b> part. The calculating itself wasn't extremely hard, but getting the values from <b>localStorage</b> was a big challenge. There was so much drama because of <b>object types.</b></span>
                <br />
                <span class="question">What did you learn from this process that will impact the way you interact with technology in the future?</span>
                <br />
                <span class="answer">I don't think I ever used the JavaScript localStorage object before this. When I was deciding what to use to <b>store the data</b> so it remembers, I couldn't think of a way to accomplish this so it <b>saves it forever</b>. Then I remembered a coding book that talked about localStorage. I Googled “how long does localStorage last”, and I learned that it lasts forever, unless you call the localStorage.clear() function. Now I have a new method in my toolbox!</span>
                <br />
                <span class="question">Why did you choose this format for your project?</span>
                <br />
                <span class="answer">I chose to do a <b>free website</b> because I want it to be accessible to everyone in the world. I also have more experience with websites than other coding formats.</span>
