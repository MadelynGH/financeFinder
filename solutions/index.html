                A created a prototype for a product called Finance Finder.
                It uses AI to help people manage their budget in a smarter way, and helps them make better decisions about their money.

                    <u>27%</u> of Americans don't <b>think</b> they need a budget!
                    But <u>94%</u> of millionaires stick to a budget and live on less than they make.
                    More importantly, almost <u>3/4</u> of those millionaires have never carried a credit card balance in their lives!<br>
                    <u>45%</u> of people say that real estate is the best way to build wealth.
                    <u>32%</u> say the stock market.
                    <u>21%</u> say saving bonds.
                    <u>21%</u> say cash.
                    <u>16%</u> say a retirement account with tax advantages.
                    <br><br>
                    Ramit Sethi, a self-made millionaire says:<br>
                    1. <u>Start investing and gradually increase the amount</u>- "Invest a percentage of your income every year automatically and increase that percentage 1%."<br>
                    2. <u>Push for the salary you deserve</u>- "Learn the skills of negotiating your salary and getting paid what you're worth."<br>
                    3. <u>Pursue a side hustle</u>- "If you really want to increase your earnings, consider starting a business on the side."

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Finance Finder</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                Finance Finder has many different tools:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <b>desktop app</b>, for deep financial planning</li>
                    <li>A <b>mobile app</b>, for making quick, on-the-go decisions</li>
                    <li>A <b>browser extension</b>, for making better choices while shopping online</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Desktop App</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                I created a desktop app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                The desktop app allows the user to input their debt and income.
                Then, the computer calculates it and gives the user tips based on their annual <b>profit</b>!
                <br><br>
                The debt is organized into <u>needs</u> and <u>wants</u>.
                Needs are stuff like a house, food, water, and clothes.
                Wants are stuff like a skateboard, or the newest iPhone model.
                The income is organized into <u>salaries</u> and <u>assets</u>.
                Salaries are the money that jobs pay. A job is being a project manager, for example, or an Uber driver.
                Assets are things you own that earn you money, like a house you're renting out, a company you own, or stocks.
                <br><br>
                The desktop app is for when the user just started using Finance Finder, or if they made a big change.
                For example, needs don't change very often. People don't just stop needing food.
                People don't change jobs very often either.
                <br><br>
                So the desktop app is primarily for when the user is sitting at their computer and ready to do deep analysis.
                You can try out the desktop app <a href="/desktop">here</a>!
            </p>
            
            <h1 class="sub-heading">Mobile App</h1>
            <p>
                I designed a mobile app using Figma, a prototyping tool.
                In the mobile app, the user would input what they want to buy, and the AI would help the user decide whether they should buy it or not.
                The user will get an icon and a paragraph.
                <br><br>
                The icon can be three different things: a checkmark, a question mark, or an X.
                The paragraph is usually talking about <u>why</u> the user got the icon they got.
                For example, let's say the user wants go roller skating with their friends.
                The AI would calculate stuff like how much they spent on entertainment that month.
                The paragraph could  be something like, "You only spent $30 on entertainment so far this month!
                Treat yourself to a roller skating night."
                <br><br>
                So the mobile app is primarily for when the user is about to purchase something, and they need to know whether they can afford it at the moment.
                You can see the design for the mobile app <span class="yes-links"><a href="/mobile">here</a></span>.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Browser Extension</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                I have an idea for a browser extension.
                This is how it would work: it would see when the user is about to purchase something online.
                If the user can afford it, it would say something like, "Okay, you can afford that. Go ahead and purchase it!"
                If the user can't afford it, it would say something like, "Are you sure you want to buy that? You've already spent $500 on home decor this month. Think again!"
                If the user is going to pay more than something's worth, it would browse the web to find cheaper options.
                Also, based on their purchase history, it would make recommendations for alternative/additional items to purchase, or tell them that they should stop buying something.
                <br>
                So basically, it would manage their online shopping, and make sure they're making smart purchases.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Financial Impact</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                The desktop app could help the user manage their money, so they can be aware of what's happening to it.
                It could help them see their debt and income from a different perspective and make sure they have good a cash flow.
                They can organize their money into different areas so if they make budget cuts, they have an idea about which stuff is best to stop buying.
                The user can do deep analysis about their debt and income, and they can see their statistics.
                <br><br>
                There are some other tools similar to the Finance Finder mobile app, like Mint or Goodbudget.
                However, those tools are for purchases you've already made, and you can't do anything about it.
                The Finance Finder mobile app is different and unique.
                In the mobile app, the user inputs something that they are about to buy, and the AI makes a decision <u>before</u> the user purchases it.
                <br><br>
                As of January 2024, 66% of the world's population were internet users.
                The total number of internet users around the world grew by 97 million during the past 12 months!
                <u>21%</u> of global retail sales are online as of 2022--
                online shopping is becoming very popular!
                So the user would need to manage their <u>online</u> shopping budget too.
                That's how the browser extension would help.
                If the user is about to purchase something they can't afford, the browser extension would jump in with an alert telling them to think twice.
                This will help the user make smarter decisions about how they spend their money online!
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Social Inequalities</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                So how does Finance Finder <b>help</b> with <a href="/problem#social-inequalities">social inequalities</a>?
                It will help those who are less wealthy become more aware of what's happening to their money.
                It can help them make better decisions based on their budget and goals.
                <u>85%</u> of those who budget say that simple process got them out of debt or has helped keep them out of debt.
                Consumers who have a budget feel more in control (<u>62%</u>),
                more confident (<u>55%</u>) and more secure (<u>52%</u>).
