                It will help those who are less wealthy become more aware of what's happening to their money.
                It can help them make better decisions based on their budget and goals.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Finance Finder</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                Finance Finder has many different tools:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <b>desktop app</b>, for deep financial planning</li>
                    <li>A <b>mobile app</b>, for making quick, on-the-go decisions</li>
                    <li>A <b>browser extension</b>, for making better choices while shopping online</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="yes-links">
                So what makes Finance Finder unique?
                <br>
                There are some other tools similar to the Finance Finder mobile app, like Mint or Goodbudget.
                However, those tools are for purchases you've already made, and you can't do anything about it.
                The Finance Finder mobile app is different and unique.
                In the mobile app, the user inputs something that they are about to buy, and the AI helps them make a decision <u>before</u> the user purchases it.
                <br><br>
                The browser extension is unique too.
                There are other financial browser extensions, but they don't use AI nor send the user a notification.
                Instead, they act as the desktop app, regular budgeting.
                Finance Finder as one product includes the desktop app, the mobile app, and the browser extension; and it is unique as a whole.
                <br><br>
                Here's a summary of Finance Finder:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finance Finder has three different tools, a <b>desktop app</b> for deep financial planning, a <b>mobile app</b> for making quick, on-the-go decisions, and a <b>browser extension</b> for making better choices while shopping online</li>

            </p>
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Desktop App</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                I created a desktop app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                The desktop app allows the user to input their debt and income.
                Then, the computer calculates it and gives the user tips based on their annual <b>profit</b>!
                <br><br>
                The debt is organized into <u>needs</u> and <u>wants</u>.
                Needs are stuff like a house, food, water, and clothes.
                Wants are stuff like a skateboard, or the newest iPhone model.
                The income is organized into <u>salaries</u> and <u>assets</u>.
                Salaries are the money that jobs pay. A job is being a project manager, for example, or an Uber driver.
                Assets are things you own that earn you money, like a house you're renting out, a company you own, or stocks.
                <br><br>
                The desktop app is for when the user just started using Finance Finder, or if they made a big change.
                For example, needs don't change very often. People don't just stop needing food.
                People don't change jobs very often either.
                <br><br>
                So the desktop app is primarily for when the user is sitting at their computer and ready to do deep analysis.
                You can try out the desktop app <a href="/desktop">here</a>!
                <br><br>
                Here's a summary of Desktop App:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I created a desktop app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                    <li>The desktop app allows the user to input their debt (needs and wants) and income (salaries and assets)</li>
                    <li>The desktop app is for when the user just started using Finance Finder, or if they made a big change.  For example, needs don't change very often. People don't just stop needing food</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h1 class="sub-heading">Mobile App</h1>
            <p>
                I designed a mobile app using Figma, a prototyping tool.
                In the mobile app, the user would input what they want to buy, and the AI would help the user decide whether they should buy it or not.
                The user will get an icon and a paragraph.
                <br><br>
                The icon can be three different things: a checkmark, a question mark, or an X.
                The paragraph is usually talking about <u>why</u> the user got the icon they got.
                For example, let's say the user wants go roller skating with their friends.
                The AI would calculate stuff like how much they spent on entertainment that month.
                The paragraph could  be something like, "You only spent $30 on entertainment so far this month!
                Treat yourself to a roller skating night."
                <br><br>
                So the mobile app is primarily for when the user is about to purchase something, and they need to know whether they can afford it at the moment.
                You can see the design for the mobile app <span class="yes-links"><a href="/mobile">here</a></span>.
                <br><br>
                Here's a summary of Mobile App:<br>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Browser Extension</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                I have an idea for a browser extension.
                This is how it would work: it would see when the user is about to purchase something online.
                If the user can afford it, it would say something like, "Okay, you can afford that. Go ahead and purchase it!"
                If the user can't afford it, it would say something like, "Are you sure you want to buy that? You've already spent $500 on home decor this month. Think again!"
                If the user is going to pay more than something's worth, it would browse the web to find cheaper options.
                Also, based on their purchase history, it would make recommendations for alternative/additional items to purchase, or tell them that they should stop buying something.
                <br>
                So basically, it would manage their online shopping, and make sure they're making smart purchases.
                <br><br>
                Here's a summary of Browser Extension:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have an idea for a browser extension</li>
                    <li>If the user is going to purchase something they can afford, it will send a message telling them it's okay</li>
                    <li>If they can't afford the item, the AI would tell them to think twice</li>
                    <li>If they user is going to get a bad deal, it would suggest cheaper options</li>
                    <li>Based on their purchase history, it would make recommendations for alternative/additional items to purchase, or tell them that they should stop buying something</li>
                    <li>So basically, it would manage their online shopping, and make sure they're making smart purchases</li>

            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Integration of AI</h1>
            <p>
                Finance Finder has a lot of AI involved in its product.
                <br><br>
                In the mobile app, the AI is helping the user make a decision about whether they should buy something or not.
                The AI helps the user make the decision by seeing how much they spent that month, how important that specific item is, etc.
                It comes up with a simple suggestion, which is displayed with an icon.
                But it also explains more about why it made that suggestion, or how much they spent that month in that category, or something like that.
                <br><br>
                In the browser extension, the AI is going to go through stuff like their purchase history, or how much money they can spend, or if other sellers offer a better deal.
                If they're about to buy something they can't afford, the AI would jump in and tell them to think twice and why they shouldn't purchase it.
                If they're getting a bad deal, the AI would offer other options.
                The AI would also make recommendations based on their purchase history, budget, etc.
                <br><br>
                Currently, the desktop app does not directly contain AI.
                However, an idea I have is to replace <u>the paragraphs that are displayed based on your annual profit</u> with
                <u>comments generated by the AI</u>.
                The comments would be stuff like tips, suggestions, and feedback.
                <br><br>
                Here's a summary of Integration of AI:<br>
                <ul>

            <p class="yes-links">
                The desktop app could help the user manage their money, so they can be aware of what's happening to it.
                It could help them see their debt and income from a different perspective and make sure they have good a cash flow.
                They can organize their money into different areas so if they make budget cuts, they have an idea about which stuff is best to stop buying.
                The user can do deep analysis about their debt and income, and they can see their statistics.
