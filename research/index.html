                I researched about this topic. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/discover/finance-ai#:~:text=AI%20in%20finance%20can%20help,automate%20operations%20and%20reduce%20costs." target="_blank">Google Cloud blog</a>,
                AI in finance can help in five general areas: personalize services
                and products, create opportunities, manage risk and fraud,
                enable transparency and compliance, and automate operations
                and reduce costs.<br><br>The <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/what-is/ai-in-finance.html#:~:text=For%20financial%20institutions,evaluate%20potential%20risk." target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a> says: For financial institutions, AI lets organizations accelerate and automate historically manual and time-consuming tasks like market research. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of data to identify trends and help forecast future performance, letting investors chart investment growth and evaluate potential risk.<br><br>AI is cool. But it has some limitations - it is just a
                computer program. It doesn't think the way we humans do. So let's
                go to <a href="https://www.jatinderpalaha.com/limitations-of-artificial-intelligence/#Lack-of-Emotional-and-Social-Understanding:~:text=AI%20decision%2Dmaking.-,Lack%20of%20Emotional%20and%20Social%20Understanding,of%20human%20behaviour%2C%20such%20as%20mental%20health%20diagnosis%20or%20customer%20service.,-Ethical%20and%20Privacy" target="_blank">Jatinder Palaha</a>. One of the limitations is Lack of Emotional
                and Social Understanding. AI falls short in understanding human
                emotions, cultural norms, and social cues.

                <a href="https://penchecks.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-financial-services-industry/#:~:text=Lack%20of%20Human,reduce%20customer%20satisfaction." target="_blank">Pen Checks</a> says that AI can also have an adverse effect on human interaction. Many customers prefer to speak to a human when they have a financial query or problem. However, the increasing use of AI means they can only interact with a machine, which can frustrate customers and reduce customer satisfaction.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Social Inequalities</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                There are a lot of social inequalities in finance. One of them is that some people are born into a poor family.
                Some people are born into a rich family. A whopping <u>21%</u> of rich people were born into a rich family!
                This is not fair for those who were born into a less wealthy family. They get less opportunities than those who were born rich!
                <u>49%</u> of babies born into a poor family will be poor for at least half their childhood.
                The richest <u>1%</u> in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom <u>90%</u>.
                <br><br>
                <u>97%</u> of people in debt say that they would be happier without it.
                <u>80%</u> of Americans are in debt and <u>73%</u> pass away with debt.
                The debt of an average American is about <u>$100,000</u>!
                In 2021, the population of the United States was about <u>331.9 million</u>.
                This means that the total debt of all the citizens of the US was 331,900,000 x $100,000 = <u>$3.319e+13</u>!
                That's crazy!
                <br><br>
                So how do people get into debt in the first place? There are a few reasons, such as
                spending more than you bring in, spending freely or extravagantly, sudden emergencies, high interest rates, and inflation.
                Every month, the average American spends <u>$288</u> on entertainment, <u>$300</u> on eating out, and <u>$148</u> on fast food.
                Their income is about <u>$4,800</u> per month and their biggest expense is housing, which costs <u>$2,025</u> per month.
                <br><br>
                So how does Finance Finder help? It will help those who are less wealthy become more aware of what's happening to their money.
                It can help them make better decisions based on their budget and goals.
                <u>85%</u> of those who budget say that simple process got them out of debt or has helped keep them out of debt.
                Consumers who have a budget feel more in control (<u>62%</u>),
                more confident (<u>55%</u>) and more secure (<u>52%</u>).

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Financial Impact</h1>
            <p class="yes-links">
                Finance Finder can make a big financial impact.
                It can help people manage their budget smarter, so they're aware of what's happening to their money.
                
                <div class="outline">
                    <br>
                    <u>27%</u> of Americans don't <b>think</b> they need a budget!
                    But <u>94%</u> of millionaires stick to a budget and live on less than they make.
                    More importantly, almost 3/4 of those millionaires have never carried a credit card balance in their lives!<br>
                    <u>45%</u> of people say that real estate is the best way to build wealth.
                    <u>32%</u> say the stock market.
                    <u>21%</u> say saving bonds.
                    <u>21%</u> say cash.
                    <u>16%</u> say a retirement account with tax advantages.
                    <br>
                    Ramit Sethi, a self-made millionaire says:<br>
                    1. <u>Start investing and gradually increase the amount</u>- "Invest a percentage of your income every year automatically and increase that percentage 1%."<br>
                    2. <u>Push for the salary you deserve</u>- "Learn the skills of negotiating your salary and getting paid what you're worth."<br>
                    3. <u>Pursue a side hustle</u>- "If you really want to increase your earnings, consider starting a business on the side."

                There are some other tools similar to Finance Finder, like Mint or Goodbudget.
                However, those tools are for purchases you've already made, and you can't do anything about it.
                Finance Finder is different and unique. In the mobile app, the user inputs something that they are about to buy,
                and the AI makes a decision <u>before the user purchases it</u>.
                <br>
                In the desktop app, the user can do deep analysis about their debt and income, and they can see their statistics.
                Finance Finder will help those who aren't currently budgeting AND those who are using a different tool.
