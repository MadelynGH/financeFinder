                I researched about this topic. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/discover/finance-ai#:~:text=AI%20in%20finance%20can%20help,automate%20operations%20and%20reduce%20costs." target="_blank">Google Cloud blog</a>,
                AI in finance can help in five general areas: personalize services
                and products, create opportunities, manage risk and fraud,
                enable transparency and compliance, and automate operations
                and reduce costs. And the <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/what-is/ai-in-finance.html" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a> says: For financial institutions, AI lets organizations accelerate and automate historically manual and time-consuming tasks like market research. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of data to identify trends and help forecast future performance, letting investors chart investment growth and evaluate potential risk. AI is cool. But it has some limitations - it is just a
                computer program. It doesn't think the way we humans do. So let's
                go to <a href="https://www.jatinderpalaha.com/limitations-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">Jatinder Palaha</a>. One of the limitations is Lack of Emotional
                and Social Understanding. AI falls short in understanding human
                emotions, cultural norms, and social cues.
