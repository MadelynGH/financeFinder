                Hi! I'm Madelyn, the creator of Finance Finder. Finance Finder is on a mission to help people
                manage their finances in a smarter way. I also want this to be accessible to all people, so it is free and user-friendly! 
                The user can input their needs, wants, jobs/salaries, and assets!
                It will calculate annual profit, annual income, annual debts, etc. And it will give them little tips too!
                <br />
                You can find more info by going to the 
                <a class="default-link" target="_blank" href="">presentation</a>!
                <br />
                This is part of the AI4FinancialGood challenge by GWC - <b>exploring how AI can be used to help people with their financial needs</b>.
                I want to thank the staff, volunteers, and community at GWC for this opportunity.
                Enjoy Finance Finder!
