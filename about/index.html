                Hi! I'm Madelyn, the creator of Finance Finder. Finance Finder is on a mission to help people
                manage their finances in a smarter way. I also want this to be accessible to all people, so it is free and user-friendly! 
                <br><br>
                In the desktop app, the user can input their needs, wants, jobs/salaries, and assets! 
                (The reason wants is one-time and everything else is annual is because salaries, for example, are paid 
                annually. Wants are usually stuff like a new computer, which is paid one time.)
                It will calculate annual profit, annual income, annual debts, etc. And it will give them little tips too!
                <br><br>
                In the mobile app, the user will input what they're about to buy, and the AI will calculate whether that's a good idea or not.
                <br><br>
                This is part of the AI4FinancialGood challenge by Girls Who Code - <b>exploring how AI can be used to help people with their financial needs</b>.
                I want to thank the staff, volunteers, community, and sponsors for this opportunity.
                Enjoy Finance Finder!
                <br><br>
